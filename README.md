# InventoryApp2
This app is an updated version of the InventoryApp (https://github.com/CredoMb/InventoryApp). 

An handful of new options have been added while core functionalities were preserved.  

Now, the user can dynamically modify the quantity by clicking on the "sale icon" in CatalogActivity or by using 2 buttons (+ and -) in EditorActivity. This helped to get rid of the shipped and sold EditTexts. 

In EditorActivity, the new "order" button creates an intent to send an email and request for more supply. 

## Prerequisites 
* Android SDK v29
* Android Build Tools v29.0.2

The mockup used to draw the application's layout was inspired by Udacity's petsApp https://github.com/udacity/ud845-Pets.git. Except that, the owner of this github profile is the only contributor to this app. New Ideas and innovative concepts are welcomed :)
